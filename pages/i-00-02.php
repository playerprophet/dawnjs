  <p>I am Anna Khatri, daughter of Ram and Saanvi, and I am writing from the After.</p>

  <p>We woke up here some time ago, although precisely how long I cannot say. This land is in a constant state of starry evening. We eat, although we aren’t hungry. We sleep, although we aren’t tired. We perform these functions as a matter of habit rather than necessity.</p>

  <p>While I could deny that this place is an afterlife based on these facts only, there are stranger things that I can’t explain.</p>

  <p>People who were once long dead are here with me.</p>

  <p>There are people here who are legendary, from tales told to me from their surviving families and friends.</p>

  <p>People I once knew are here, and some of them have changed immensely.</p>

  <p>Then there are people I don’t know, who remember a world I can hardly wrap my head around. They talk about things that I can’t understand. They tell me that I was, myself, long dead in their time. They knew me from stories, and lived in a time after me.</p>

  <p>That we are occupying an afterlife is the only explanation I have, but I have another question:</p>

  <p>Why are we here?</p>
